System Requirements
Decide whether to create a web, desktop or mobile application.


Game Mechanics
NOTE: Requirements will depend on the game mechanics chosen.
Gameplay options as well as ‘winning scenarios’ include:
Players select start points and each “live” cell colors in the GUI grid.  First player to completely color in their grid wins.
Set a time limit to play the simulation, depending on the players start positions, at the end of the time limit whoever created more living cells wins.
Set up system to determine a “turn” and used a turn based system to decide on the winner depending on:
Greatest grid color filled
Total number of living cells created throughout the game
Which player killed the most cells
Allow players to predict which cells will belong to their color after a set number of iterations pass
If a player correctly predicts a cell, it is then locked to their color permanently
The player who locks down the desired amount of territory wins. This could be 50% or some other amount determined to be sensible through play testing.
Divide the game board up into sections. Allow the player(s) to pick a set number of sections. The player will receive points depending on the number of cells in their chosen section(s) after a certain number of iterations.
The game board is evenly divided up into sections.
Before the game starts, there are X number of cells placed randomly on the board.
The player(s) will select X number of sections before the game runs.
The game runs for X number of iterations and then stops.
The player receives 1 point per cell that is in their chosen section.



Create different controls
NOTE: Controls for the game will also depend on the type of game pursued. Some of the standard controls we discussed are:
Start
Stop
Pause
Speed
Choose icons for player representation
Color
Image
Display statistics
Live stats
Stats between “turns”


























Stated below are a list of requirements that will most likely apply to the game (regardless of game type, winning conditions). 

Case 1: Desktop Application
CSCI External Interface Requirements
No external interfaces in the case of the desktop application (unless we decide on online multiplayer instead of local multiplayer).
CSCI Internal Interface Requirements
Internal Interface requirements are ultimately subject to the final design of the application.
The application shall have a main menu screen.
The main menu screen shall have an “Exit Game” button.
The “Exit Game” button shall allow the user to terminate the application when clicked.
The main menu screen shall have a “Start Game” button.
The “Start Game” button shall bring up a windows where the user may specify initial game options.
Initial game options shall include the option to change player “cell” colors.
Initial game option shall include the option to change player game image.
Initial game options shall include the option to change the game board grid size ***
The initial game options window shall have a button to allow the game to start.
The application shall have a window that displays gameplay statistics.
The gameplay statistics window shall be displayed after X number of iterations.
The gameplay statistics window shall display the player name.
The gameplay statistics window shall display <insert stat here>
The gameplay statistics windows shall have a button that allows the player to continue the game.
The gameplay statistics window shall have a button that allows the player to leave the game to return to the main menu screen.
CSCI Internal Data Requirements
The application shall store any user gameplay statistics locally on their system.
Security and Privacy Requirements
This will depend on whether sensitive user information (i.e. passwords) will be processed/stored by the application 
The application shall store a hash of the user’s passwords (not plaintext).
CSCI Environments Requirements
The application shall operate on the Windows 10 operating system.
Do we want this to be on Mac? NO
Computer Resource Requirements
The application shall utilize the system’s keyboard.
The application shall utilize the system’s mouse or pointer device.
Case 2: Web Application

CSCI External Interface Requirements
The player shall connect to the application (web server) via their web browser.***
The web server shall verify user credentials before providing the game service.
The web server shall provide a game server to allow online multiplayer of the game service.
The web server shall allows X number of users to connect to a single game server.
See Figure 1 for a possible diagram detailing the interaction of the interfaces.
CSCI Internal Interface Requirements
Internal Interface requirements are ultimately subject to the final design of the application.
The application shall have a main menu screen.
The main menu screen shall have an “Exit Game” button.
The “Exit Game” button shall allow the user to terminate the application when clicked.
The main menu screen shall have a “Start Game” button.
The “Start Game” button shall bring up a windows where the user may specify initial game options.
Initial game options shall include the option to change player “cell” colors.
Initial game option shall include the option to change player game image.
Initial game options shall include the option to change the game board grid size ***
The initial game options window shall have a button to allow the game to start.
The application shall have a window that displays gameplay statistics.
The gameplay statistics window shall be displayed after X number of iterations.
The gameplay statistics window shall display the player name.
The gameplay statistics window shall display <insert stat here>
The gameplay statistics windows shall have a button that allows the player to continue the game.
The gameplay statistics window shall have a button that allows the player to leave the game to return to the main menu screen.
CSCI Internal Data Requirements
The application shall store any user gameplay statistics locally on their system. ***
The application shall store any user gameplay statistics in a database on the web server. ***
The user credentials shall be stored in a hash table in the web server.
Security and Privacy Requirements
This will depend on whether sensitive user information (i.e. passwords) will be processed/stored by the application
The application shall salt the user passwords.
The application shall store a hash of the user’s passwords (not plaintext).
CSCI Environments Requirements
The application shall operate on the Google Chrome browser. ***
The application shall operate on the Firefox browser. ***
The application shall operate on the Microsoft Edge browser. ***
Computer Resource Requirements
The application shall utilize the system’s keyboard.
The application shall utilize the system’s mouse or pointer device.
